Hooks don't work inside classes — they let you use React without classes.

3. What is virtual DOM?

A "virtual DOM" is a lightweight, in-memory representation of a web page's actual DOM (Document Object Model), 
used by JavaScript frameworks like React to optimize rendering performance by efficiently calculating only the necessary updates
to the real DOM instead of manipulating it directly every time a change occurs;

4. What is event loop in node.js?

The event loop is a crucial mechanism in Node.js that enables it to perform non-blocking I/O operations, despite running on a single thread.
It continuously monitors the call stack and the event queue, executing tasks accordingly.

==================

MCQ questions

1.   '2' + 3 + 4 what is the output in Javascript? "234"

2. how do you convert string to integer? ParseInt()

3. In node.js which function performs asynchronous calls?
In Node.js, asynchronous operations are primarily handled using callbacks, Promises, and the async/await syntax.

4. In retail industry, What is most important in React?

In React, both props and state are essential concepts which are used to manage and control the behavior and appearance of components. 
Props or properties are used to pass data between the components (parent to child, child to parent, between siblings etc.).

5. Explain the use of 'key' in react list
Keys allow you to provide each list element with a stable identity. The keys should be unique.

6. What is Context?
React context helps you to pass data using the tree of react components. It helps you to
share data globally between various react components.

7. What is the use of Webpack?
Webpack in basically is a module builder. It is mainly runs during the development process.

8. Explain the term synthetic events
It is actually a cross-browser wrapper around the browser’s native event. 
These events have interface stopPropagation() and preventDefault().

9. What is the difference between Shadow DOM and Virtual DOM?
The Shadow DOM is a browser technology designed primarily for scoping variables and CSS in web components. 
The Virtual DOM is a concept implemented by libraries in JavaScript on top of browser APIs.

**Answer:**
I’ve been working with Node.js for over 5 years, and during this time, I’ve built numerous applications including REST APIs, microservices, and real-time applications. I ensure performance and scalability in Node.js by following best practices such as avoiding blocking the event loop, using async/await for non-blocking I/O, and ensuring proper error handling with try/catch blocks.

For scalability, I focus on load balancing using tools like Nginx and clustering with Node’s cluster module. I also make use of Redis for caching and horizontal scaling, ensuring that the application can handle large amounts of traffic efficiently. In terms of performance optimization, I continuously monitor Node.js applications using tools like New Relic and PM2, identifying bottlenecks and refactoring them for improved throughput.

### **3. How have you used Jest in your development workflow?**

**Answer:**
Jest has been my go-to testing framework for over 5 years, and I use it extensively for both unit and integration testing in my projects. I believe in the importance of writing tests first (TDD) to ensure that the code works as expected and is easy to maintain. In my workflow, I set up Jest alongside Babel to transpile the latest JavaScript and TypeScript code for testing. 

I write comprehensive test suites, including mocking external dependencies with tools like `jest.mock()` and using `beforeEach`/`afterEach` hooks for setting up and tearing down test data. I also use coverage reporting to ensure that I’m testing all edge cases and that my code is fully covered. For continuous integration, I’ve integrated Jest with CI/CD pipelines to run tests automatically on each commit.

### **4. How do you use Redux in React applications to manage state effectively?**

**Answer:**
I’ve been using Redux for over 5 years and have found it to be a powerful tool for managing state in complex React applications. I use Redux to handle application-wide state and ensure that components are decoupled from each other by using actions, reducers, and a centralized store.

In large applications, I combine Redux with middleware like Redux-Saga or Redux-Thunk for handling side effects such as asynchronous API calls. I also emphasize the importance of using selectors and reselect to avoid unnecessary re-renders and optimize performance. I follow best practices like keeping reducers pure, using action creators, and ensuring immutability to maintain a predictable state.

Additionally, I’ve worked with Redux Toolkit to streamline Redux code and reduce boilerplate, making state management more efficient and easier to maintain.

### **5. Can you describe a complex system you’ve designed and delivered under tight deadlines?**

**Answer:**
One project that stands out was designing and delivering a large-scale e-commerce platform under a very tight deadline. The system needed to integrate real-time inventory updates, manage large volumes of user transactions, and provide a seamless user experience with a modern UI.

Initially, the requirements were vague, but I worked closely with the product team and stakeholders to define the high-level goals. Using SOLID principles, I designed the system to be modular and scalable, with separate microservices for user authentication, inventory management, and order processing. I implemented TypeScript for type safety, Node.js for the back-end, and React with Redux for the front-end.

We faced tight deadlines, so I prioritized features based on business needs and worked iteratively, delivering MVPs for each service. I also implemented CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment. Despite the challenges, the system was successfully delivered on time, and we met the performance benchmarks set by the business.

### **6. How do you approach continuous improvement and applying feedback in your work?**

**Answer:**
I see continuous improvement as a key part of personal and professional growth.

For instance, if I receive feedback on improving the readability of my code, I focus on enhancing my commenting, naming conventions, and simplifying complex logic. Additionally, I try to learn from my mistakes, adapt my approach to new challenges, and stay updated with the latest industry trends through reading, courses, and conferences.

I also encourage feedback within my team, as a collaborative approach leads to better solutions and fosters a culture of excellence.

### **7. How do you apply SOLID principles in your daily coding practice?**

**Answer:**
The SOLID principles guide my coding decisions and ensure that my code is clean, maintainable, and scalable.

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** I ensure that each function or class has only one responsibility, making it easier to understand, test, and modify.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** I design my code to be open for extension but closed for modification, typically by using polymorphism and interfaces.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** I make sure that derived classes can be used interchangeably with their base classes without affecting functionality.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** I prefer small, focused interfaces that cater to specific needs rather than large, generic ones.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** I decouple high-level modules from low-level ones by using dependency injection, making it easier to swap out components for better testing and flexibility.

By adhering to these principles, I ensure that the code I write is modular, extensible, and easy to maintain, even as the system grows over time.
